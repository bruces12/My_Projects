# My_Projects
This is a collection of some of my work.

Stock Analyzer: builds a class for analyzing stocks, and a wide variety of various statisical features
	
chess_cpp: builds a console application for playing chess using C++
	
naive_bayes: creates a class for training a model using the naive bayes algorithm
  
neural_net_from_scratch: provides functions for defining and training a neural network, I calculate the gradients analytically and use
                gradient descent for trainging
  
tensorflow: a couple examples of using the tensorflow library.
  
Git_hub_stuff/FacialRecognition: I use the SVD decompisition and PCA to create facial recognition software
  
Git_hub_stuff/Fourier: I code up the fast fourier transformation and do some fourier analysis, I also use 1D convolution on some audio
                files.
  
Git_hub_stuff/GDP_modeling: I scrape, clean and analyze data from both the CIA and world bank to group cuntries and perform analysis for 
                modeling GDP growth.
  
Git_hub_stuff/Letter_Conv: I use convolutional neural networks (implemented with tensorflow) to train a model to recognize handwritten
                characters.  I also code an algorithm for calculating levenshtein distance to predict entire words from a provided
                dictionary.
  
Git_hub_stuff/page_rank: I code up the page rank algorithm and use it to rank NCAA basketball teams
  
Git_hub_stuff/policy_iteration: I solve the classical one armed bandit problem using policy iteration and minimax optimization.
  
Git_hub_stuff/naiton)sim: Just a fun project I did to build a class that roughly simulates nations fighting against each other.
